Opinionated fork of lift's Box (https://github.com/lift/framework/blob/master/core/common/src/main/scala/net/liftweb/common/Box.scala) to work in Scala.js
* deprecations removed
* get's are allowed
* removed some Java-specific stuff (we are a Scala and Scala.js only shop)

Originally based off of of lift framework 3.1.0.
